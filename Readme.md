# pyaixm

Parses Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) xml data to python dataclasses.

* temporal information is ignored
* not all AIXM feature types are implemented
* most of the feature attributes are represented as str

## Installation and usage

After cloning this repository

```bash
$ pip install .
```

File *example.py*

```python
from pprint import pprint
import sys

import pyaixm

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with open(sys.argv[1], 'rb') as f:
        features = pyaixm.parse(f, resolve_xlinks=True)
        pprint(features)

```

Function *parse()* parses xml from file. If *resolve_links* is true xlink:href references are
replaced with the features i.e. dataclasses they refer to. Otherwise the *target* attribute on the XLink
dataclass refers to the feature.

The package can be executed directly. It dumps the AIXM data as json.

```bash
$ python -m pyaixm aixm_input_file.xml
```
